Project Description: Parking Inventory Management System

A Parking Management System is a software application that allows users to manage parking facilities efficiently. The system is designed 
to help parking lot owners manage their parking spaces, monitor occupancy . The system also allows drivers to find available parking spaces, 
reserve parking spots in advance, and pay for parking online.

The Parking Management System consists of two main components: the administrator module and the driver module. 
The parking lot management module is used by the parking lot owners or administrators to manage parking facilities, monitor occupancy,
and generate reports. The driver module helps drivers to find available parking spaces, reserve parking spots in advance, and pay for parking.

Key Features:
1) Parking lot management: The system allows parking lot owners to manage their parking facilities efficiently, monitor occupancy, and generate reports.
2) Real-time parking information: The system provides real-time information to drivers about the availability of parking spaces in the parking facility.
3) Parking reservation: The system allows drivers to reserve parking spots in advance, ensuring that they have a spot reserved for them when they arrive at the parking lot.
4) Payment gateway integration: The system integrates with various payment gateways to allow drivers to pay for parking online, eliminating the need for cash payments.
5) Automated parking management: The system automates parking management tasks, such as monitoring parking occupancy, and generating reports.

Benefits:

1)Efficient parking management
2)Improved customer experience
3)Reduced traffic congestion

Conclusion:

A Parking Management System is an essential tool for parking lot owners to manage their facilities efficiently and provide an improved experience to their customers. 
The system automates parking management tasks,provides real-time parking information, and integrates with payment gateways,
 making it easier for drivers to find available parking spaces and pay for parking.
